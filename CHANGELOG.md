## 0.2.0 - 2023-01-13

### Changed

- `hashbrown` was updated to 0.13.2
- The version of `hashbrown` is now pinned to the exact minor version
- The `Into<K>` bound from `insert`, `get_or_insert_fallible` and `get_or_insert` was removed
- `get_or_insert` and `get_or_insert_fallible` now accept borrowed keys

### Fixed

- Rehash the map in-place instead of trying to resize it from scratch with the same bucket count
  when there are a lot of deleted elements; this fixes a performance regression where the map was
  getting recreated a lot more often than necessary
